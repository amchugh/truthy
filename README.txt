Our project is a Google Chrome extension called Angle
that compiles data from three analyses of bias and 
reliability of over 1200 different news sources 
and input from other Angle users to show the user
every time they open a new news source. Our project
fits the themes of Education, as every user can take
into consideration the biases of the sources they
read from as well as Big Data as we take data from
three very large databases and compile the data.
